        <div class="answer"><pre>The PDF appears to be a quiz document related to a course on data acquisition and handling (DAH) in particle physics. The purpose is to assess students&#x27; understanding of various concepts and techniques used in experiments, particularly at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

**Structure:**
- The document is structured as a series of questions, each with a specific focus and mark allocation.
- It includes instructions on submission and deadlines.

**Main Topics/Sections:**
1. **ADC Bit Calculation**: Understanding the number of bits required for an Analog-to-Digital Converter in a particle physics experiment.
2. **I2C Bus and Addressing**: Working with a PCF8574AN expander I/O chip and understanding hexadecimal addressing.
3. **Drift Chamber Electronics**: Equipment needed for reading signal pulses in a drift chamber.
4. **22Na Decay and Coincidence Measurements**: Using detectors and single-channel analyzers to measure γ-rays.
5. **Signal Peak Analysis**: Understanding resolution and Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) in data distributions, with a programming task to simulate a Gaussian distribution.

        <h2>2) Assume that the PDF contains one or more tasks to undertake, or questions to answer. Identify each one, quote the relevant text, and then provide an example ans…</h2>
        <div class="answer"><pre>Here are the tasks/questions identified in the PDF, along with example answers:

### Question 1:
**Text:**
&quot;In a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, photons are recorded in an electromagnetic crystal calorimeter... In order to measure photon energies in the dynamic range of 40 MeV to 2.0 TeV, how many bits are required for the ADC?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
To determine the number of bits required for the ADC, calculate the range of energies: \(2.0 \, \text{TeV} = 2.0 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}\) and \(40 \, \text{MeV} = 40 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}\). The dynamic range is \(2.0 \times 10^{12} / 40 \times 10^6 = 5 \times 10^4\). The number of bits \(n\) is given by \(2^n \geq 5 \times 10^4\). Solving gives \(n \approx 16\).

### Question 2:
**Text:**
&quot;In DAH checkpoint (4) a PCF8574AN expander I/O chip was used... What would the address be if all address lines were connected to 3.3V? How many PCF8574AN chips can be controlled in total from one Raspberry Pi?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
If all address lines are connected to 3.3V, the address changes from 0x38 to 0x3F. The PCF8574AN allows for 8 different addresses, so a total of 8 chips can be controlled from one Raspberry Pi.

### Question 3:
**Text:**
&quot;In a particle physics experiment, a drift chamber with 384 anode wires is used... What electronics equipment is required to read out the signal pulses of the drift chamber?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
The electronics equipment required includes a pre-amplifier to convert charge signals to voltage pulses, a digitizer to sample the pulses, and a data acquisition system to record the information. Specifications should include a sampling rate sufficient to capture the 6.5 µs maximum drift time and a resolution better than 200 µm.

### Question 4:
**Text:**
&quot;The 22Na nuclei decays... With the aid of a diagram show the sequence of pulses from the detector to the coincidence unit... Why might delay generators be necessary?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
TTL stands for Transistor-Transistor Logic, indicating digital output pulses. Delay generators are necessary to synchronize pulses reaching the coincidence counter, compensating for any differences in signal path lengths.

### Question 5:
**Text:**
&quot;A peak in a data distribution... Explain what the resolution (σ) and the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of a signal peak in a distribution are. Derive the relation, FWHM= 2√2 log 2 σ...&quot;

**Example Answer:**
Resolution (σ) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, indicating the spread of the data. FWHM is the width of the peak at half its maximum height. The relation is derived from the properties of a Gaussian function: \(FWHM = 2\sqrt{2 \ln 2} \cdot \sigma \approx 2.355 \cdot \sigma\).

**Python Script Task:**
Write a Python script to generate a Gaussian distribution, plot it, and calculate the mean and variance.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
mu, sigma = 0, 1
data = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

# Plot
plt.hist(data, bins=30, density=True)
plt.title(&#x27;Gaussian Distribution&#x27;)
plt.xlabel(&#x27;Value&#x27;)
plt.ylabel(&#x27;Frequency&#x27;)
plt.show()

# Calculate mean and variance
mean = np.mean(data)
variance = np.var(data)

print(f&quot;Mean: {mean}, Variance: {variance}&quot;)
```

This script generates a Gaussian distribution with specified mean and standard deviation, plots the histogram, and calculates the mean and variance of the generated data.</pre></div>
