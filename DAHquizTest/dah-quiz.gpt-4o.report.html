        <h2>2) Assume that the PDF contains one or more tasks to undertake, or questions to answer. Identify each one, quote the relevant text, and then provide an example ans…</h2>
        <div class="answer"><pre>### Task 1: ADC Bit Requirement
**Question:**
&quot;In a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, photons are recorded in an electromagnetic crystal calorimeter. Each crystal is read out with a photodetector and the signals are digitised with an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). In order to measure photon energies in the dynamic range of 40 MeV to 2.0 TeV, how many bits are required for the ADC?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
To determine the number of bits required, calculate the ratio of the maximum to minimum energy and take the base-2 logarithm. The dynamic range is from 40 MeV to 2.0 TeV, which is \(2.0 \times 10^{12} \text{eV} / 40 \times 10^6 \text{eV} = 5 \times 10^4\). The number of bits \(n\) is given by \(n = \lceil \log_2(5 \times 10^4) \rceil \approx 16\).

### Task 2: I2C Addressing
**Question:**
&quot;In DAH checkpoint (4) a PCF8574AN expander I/O chip was used to control a LED light pattern. You were instructed to connect all address lines (A0, A1, A2) to ground which corresponds to the address 0x38. What would the address be if all address lines were connected to 3.3V?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
If all address lines (A0, A1, A2) are connected to 3.3V, the address changes to 0x3F. This is because each line adds a binary &#x27;1&#x27; to the address, changing it from 0b00111000 (0x38) to 0b00111111 (0x3F).

### Task 3: Drift Chamber Electronics
**Question:**
&quot;In a particle physics experiment, a drift chamber with 384 anode wires is used to measure trajectories of charged particles. The drift velocity is 1 cm/µs, the maximum drift time is 6.5 µs and a spatial resolution of better than 200 µm is needed. What electronics equipment is required to read out the signal pulses of the drift chamber?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
The electronics equipment required includes a fast pre-amplifier to convert charge signals to voltage pulses, a digitizer with sufficient sampling rate to capture the drift time accurately, and a data acquisition system capable of handling 384 channels simultaneously with a resolution better than 200 µm.

### Task 4: Coincidence Measurements
**Question:**
&quot;With the aid of a diagram show the sequence of pulses from the detector to the coincidence unit, illustrating how a single-channel analyser works. What does TTL stand for? What does this imply about the output pulses of the single-channel analyser?&quot;

**Example Answer:**
TTL stands for Transistor-Transistor Logic. This implies that the output pulses of the single-channel analyser are digital signals with standard TTL voltage levels (0V for low and 5V for high). The sequence involves the detector generating a voltage pulse, which is processed by the single-channel analyser to produce a TTL pulse if the input is within a specified range, followed by a delay generator before reaching the coincidence counter.

### Task 5: Signal Peak Analysis
**Question:**
&quot;Explain what the resolution (σ) and the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of a signal peak in a distribution are. Derive the relation, FWHM= 2√2 log 2 σ, for the resolution σ of a Gaussian distribution.&quot;

**Example Answer:**
The resolution (σ) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, indicating the spread of the data. The FWHM is the width of the distribution at half its maximum height. For a Gaussian distribution, FWHM is derived from the properties of the Gaussian function: \( \text{FWHM} = 2\sqrt{2 \ln 2} \cdot \sigma \approx 2.355 \cdot \sigma \).

**Python Script Example:**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
mu, sigma = 0, 1
data = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

# Plot
plt.hist(data, bins=30, density=True)
plt.title(&#x27;Gaussian Distribution&#x27;)
plt.xlabel(&#x27;Value&#x27;)
plt.ylabel(&#x27;Frequency&#x27;)
plt.show()

# Calculate mean and variance
mean = np.mean(data)
variance = np.var(data)

print(f&quot;Mean: {mean}, Variance: {variance}&quot;)
```
This script generates a Gaussian distribution, plots it, and calculates the mean and variance to verify the input values.</pre></div>
